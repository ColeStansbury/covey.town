# Covey.Town Newly Added Features
## Feature Overview
In this new version of Covey.Town, a full featured text chat has been added. The text chat includes:
1. A dedicated chat for each town, allowing users to communicate with all members simultaneously.
2. Direct messaging between individual users, allowing for private 1-on-1 text conversation.
3. Chat highlighting of other users via Mentions that catch their attention.

## Covey.Town Text Chat User Guide
### Upon Entering the Town - Opening the Chat Box
Upon logging in the Covey.Town, the chat box will be available in one of two ways:
1. On larger devices, the chat box will be automatically open on the far right of the screen.
2. On smaller devices, a message button will be available on the lower right of the screen. When the user clicks on the chat button, the chat box will open on the right side of the screen. It can be closed by clicking the button once more.

### Typing Messages and Chat Focus
In each Covey.Town town, users have an avatar representation that they can use to navigate the town map. Because users can use their keyboard to interact with the town that they are in, the chat box needs to be in focus in order to type text. In order to bring the chat box into focus, it will need to be opened.

Once the chat box is open, the user will have to click in the text field at the bottom of the chat box in order to begin typing their message. When the desired message has been entered, the user will have to click on the message send button which is located either to the right of or directly below the text box depending on the size of the device. The message send button is denoted with a red arrow.

Should the user wish to return focus back to their avatar in the town map, they simply need to click anywhere outside the text field in the chat box. With the focus returned to the town map, text will no longer appear in the chat box's text field and keyboard inputs will again perform interactions within the town.

### Public and Private Messaging
#### Public Messaging
By default upon entering a town and opening the chat box, messages will be sent to the current town you are in. Public messages to the town can be seen by all members of the town. Because a chat history is stored, when new members join the town, they will have access to all previously sent public messages upon entering.

Public messages sent to the town are signified by "Town" being displayed at the top of the chat box in the "Select A Player" dropdown menu.

#### Private Messaging
In order to send a private message, another user must be selected from the "Select A Player" dropdown menu. The dropdown menu can be found at the top of the chat box. Once a player is selected, their name will then be displayed at the top of the chat box (within the dropdown menu). Whichever user's name is displayed will be the recipient of messages sent until a new user is selected.

All private messages between two users are, of course, private. They will not be displayed to any other user other than the intended recipient. Because Covey.Town users are anonymous, if a user were to leave a town and return, their private chat history would be lost to them. This is the case even if the user returns with the same name.

If at any time a user would like to switch back to sending public messages to the entire town, "Town" can be selected from the "Select A Player" dropdown menu.

### User Mentions
Should the user wish to mention another user in public chat, they can make use of the Covey.Town chat Mentions feature. Mentions allow the user to notify another user and grab their attention by letting them know that you mentioned them by name in chat.

In order to mention someone, the user simply has to type the "@" symbol into the text field to begin the process. Once "@" has been entered into the text field, the entire list of names in the town will be scrollable. From there, the user can either scroll to find the user they would like to mention or continue typing the name. As the user types, the list of names matching will be filtered down. With the desired user selected, the rest of the message can be finished and sent. Once the message is sent, a notification will display at the bottom of the mentioned user's screen letting them know that they have been mentioned in chat by another user.
